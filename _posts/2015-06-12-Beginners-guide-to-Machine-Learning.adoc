Before starting, we are assuming that you know what machine learning is and what are its applications and want answer to the question 
*"how to get started"*

You might be completely overwhelmed by the information available over the internet
and must be looking on how to start the journey in the world of data analytics,
don't worry we are here to help , below you will find must know things to get 
started and to learn everything about machine learning.  +

One can directly get started using various available tools like R studio, Amazon machine learning as a service
Azure Machine learning, Anaconda(ipython) etc.
but before you do that you must know the basics or building blocks of machine learning approach.

*Neural nets*/ *Support Vector Machine* etc might sound great but the model
implementation is the last step. The most important step is cleaning and processing the data,
we will talk about it later in detail.

For now, following topics are the building blocks, we will post about each of
them in seperate posts .




. *Statistics*
. *Linear Algebra*
. *Data Cleaning*
. *Data Processing (Dimension Reduction)*
. *Feature Selection*


It's time to clean the dust off your Math/Statistics book and revise the concepts about Linear algebra and Mean/Mode/Standard Deviation , till you do that we will write the post
about next step, where we will learn a algortihm *(PCA)* for data processing and get hands on data cleaning and processing step using Anaconda(ipython).

Don't worry if this information also overwhelmed you , we will teach you 
each and everything, Just stick with us.

*Happy Learning, See you next week*
